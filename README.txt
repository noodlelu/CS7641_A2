A2: Randomized Optimization

All the algorithms are running in ABAGAIL, so please download the package from: https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL 

The source code for the three optimization problems are:
-ContinuousPeaks.java
-Knapsack_mimic.java
-Knapsack.java
-TravelingSalesman.java
-TravellingSales_ga.java

The source code for the neural network problem are:
-telescope_ga.java
-telescope_rhc.java
-telescope_sa.java

Then copy all the code to src/opt/mlu324

Compile abajail.jar to run the experiments.
